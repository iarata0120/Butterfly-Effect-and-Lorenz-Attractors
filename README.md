# Butterfly-Effect-and-Lorenz-Attractors
Pygame modeling of Lorenz equations (refer to wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) using numerical approximations and scipy odeint

Inspired by QuantitativeBytes YT video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxrnmFitxhg&ab_channel=QuantitativeBytes

Unlike the pygame drawings drawn on the video however, I flipped the orientation along the z-axis upon drawing in order to get a more butterfly-like figure and also incorporated additional functionality.

Keyboard commands:
Press keys "p" or "Space" to pause while modeling
Press keys "q" or "Escape" to quit
Press key "r" to restart

Colors are randomized each run. Change on_init() function as desired for both files to configure colors of respective attractors.
